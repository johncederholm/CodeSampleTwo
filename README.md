Code Sample Two - John Cederholm iOS

This project is based on a framework I made for "d2i." The framework is a UIScrollView-based module that was originally meant
to allow customers to drag and zoom between several product pictures. However, it has great utility outside of its original
purpose. 

For this sample, I added the source files for this uncompiled framework in "Voting App/PagingScrollSrc." I also added
a bottom UIView popup file, a class func, a singleton (which I will continue to fill with options), and performed some 
animations (UIView-based, but I prefer Facebook's pop module).

Again, please let me know if you have any questions at johncederholm@d2iapp.com

Thank you again and I hope you have a great day.

John
